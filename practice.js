# Example Graph:
#      A
#     / \
#    B   C
#   / \   \
#  D   E   F
# This graph can be represented as an adjacency list.


# Find all nodes connected to each node. 
# E.g. 
#  - A is connected to A, B, C, D, E, F
#  - B is connected to A, D, E
#  - C is connected to A, F
#  - D is connected to B
#  - E is connected to B
#  - F is connected to C

1) Create Adjacency List To represent Graph
2) Find all connected Nodes per each node (node passed in, output all connected nodes.)

Example 1.
# Input A
# Output: A B C D E F
