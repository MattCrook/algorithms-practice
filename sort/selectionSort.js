// ------------------------------- SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM --------------------------------- //
/*
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. 
It works by reducing the unsorted portion of the array step by step.
- It uses in-place sorting, meaning the algorithm sorts the array in place without needing extra memory
- it is non-stable meaning that it may change the relative order of equal elements
- The algorithm always performs O(nÂ²) comparisons, regardless of the input's order.
