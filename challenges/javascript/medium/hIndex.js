H INDEX

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.
- According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
  - The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Example 1:
 - Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 - Output: 3
 - Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 - Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
 - Output: 1

// To compute the researcher's h-index, we can sort the citations array in non-increasing order and then iterate through the sorted array.

// Complexity
// - Time complexity: O(nlogn)
// - Space complexity:
//   - O(1), as we are sorting the array in-place and using only constant extra space.
//     - O(sort)
