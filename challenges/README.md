## Challenges

Collection of word problem coding challenges (such as LeetCode, etc..) in Python and Javascript. Implementing many of the various data structures and algorithms in this repo as well as many more.

##### Again, to see full list and more details per each algorithm, please refer to my blog post which corresponds to this repository:

<br>

#### Examples include:

* Adding Binary Strings
* Binary Search and Binary Search with Recursion
* Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search
* Circular Buffer
* Climbing Stairs and Distinct Ways to Climb
* Reversing a String
* Converting an List/Array to Binary Search Tree
* Finding Occurrence of First Index in a String
* Finding The Index of a Target in a Sorted List/Array
* Two Sum and Returning Indices of Two Numbers Such That They Add Up to A Target.
* Shuffle a List/Array
* Many more...

To run a file and see the `printed` or `console.log` output, depending on if Python or Javascript, simply cd into the directory where the file is, and run (respectively):
* `python filename.py`
* `node filename.js`
