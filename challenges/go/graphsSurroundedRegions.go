//############################### Graph Traversal (General) ###############################//
// You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

// Connect:
// - A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
// Region:
// - To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
// Surround:
// - The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
// A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the input matrix board.

// Example 1:
// Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
// Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

// xxxx      xxxx
// xoox      xxxx
// xxox  =>  xxxx
// xoxx      xoxx
// In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

// Example 2:
// Input: board = [["X"]]
// Output: [["X"]]

// ----------------Solution 01 ---------//
// This problem could be solved two ways:

// Identify all isolated 'O' cells and mark them as 'X' then.
// Mark all accessible from boarders 'O' and then turn all inaccessible ones into 'X'.
// This solution is about the second way.

// To mark cells as "reachable", algorithm changing their values to 'R' instead of 'O'.

// Follow through left and right borders of the board and look for 'O' cells. If found recursevly mark all accessible 'O' cells as 'R'.
// Follow through top and bottom borders of the board and do the same.
// Follow through the whole board and flip 'O' -> 'X' and 'R' -> 'O'
// Time compexity: O(N * M), where N is the height of the board and M is the width of the board. Since in the wrost case algorithm processes all cells twice and O(2 * N * M) == O(N * M)
// Space complexity: O(N * M) â€” only the fixed set of variables of the fixed size is allocated and all 'marks' are done 'in-place' BUT recursive function calls are stored on the stack and use N * M memory in the worst case. There are no "real" allocations since the stack is allocated when the program starts, but space complexity is about all used space.
