# H INDEX
#
# Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.
# - According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
#   - The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
# Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

# Example 2:
# Input: citations = [1,3,1]
# Output: 1

# citations_01 = [3,0,6,1,5]
# citations_02 = [1,3,1]

#------------ SOLUTION #1 ----------------#
# The h-index is a metric to evaluate the impact of a researcher's publications.
# It is defined as the maximum value h such that the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
#  - The problem can be solved by sorting the array and iterating through it to check where the condition is satisfied.
# Key idea: After sorting the array, the number of papers with citations greater than or equal to a certain value can be easily determined using their index.
#
# Complexity
#  - Time complexity: O(nlog n)
#  - Space complexity: O(1)

# To compute the researcher's h-index, we can sort the citations array in non-increasing order and then iterate through the sorted array.
# - For each citation count, we compare it to the number of papers that have at least that many citations, which can be calculated as the remaining elements in the array.
# - If the citation count is greater than or equal to the number of papers with at least that many citations, we have found the h-index.

# For example, given the citations array [3,0,6,1,5], we can sort it to obtain [6,5,3,1,0].
# - We then iterate through the sorted array and for each citation count, we compare it to the number of remaining elements in the array.
# - For the first element, 6, there are 5 remaining elements in the array, all of which have at least 6 citations, so the h-index is 6.
# - For the second element, 5, there are 4 remaining elements in the array, all of which have at least 5 citations, so the h-index is 5.
# - For the third element, 3, there are 3 remaining elements in the array that have at least 3 citations, so the h-index is 3.

# Time Complexity:
#  - O(nlogn), where n is the length of the citations array.
#  - This is because we need to sort the array in non-increasing order, which takes O(nlogn) time.
# Space Complexity:
#  - O(1), as we are sorting the array in-place and using only constant extra space.
